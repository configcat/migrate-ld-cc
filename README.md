# Migrate LaunchDarkly To ConfigCat

The script in this repo is outdated and not fully functional. Another, more complete built-in solution has been
developed and is now publicly available on the [ConfigCat Dashboard](https://app.configcat.com/organization).
For more information, please refer to [the official migration guide](https://configcat.com/docs/advanced/migration-from-ld/).

The original readme for this repo is available [here](./README.original.md).
